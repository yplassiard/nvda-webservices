<h1>NVDA-WebServices: Remote web service support for NVDA.</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This add-on is a tentative to enable external services or software to be controlled by NVDA using a single and unique interface.
Each service is an object derived from a <code>Service</code> class and must implement several methods to be run properly. When properly configured, the user can access one or more service-specific menus to interract with it.</p>
<h2>Supported services</h2>
<p>Currently, the add-on has the following services built in:
- OBS Studio remote control: change scenes, toggle sources visibility, and start/stop sreaming/recording.
- <a href="https://github.com/yplassiard/nvda-talker">NVDATalker</a> - use this tiny NVDA program to declare, populate and manipulate service data directly from the CLI or from another program.</p>
<h2>Service interface</h2>
<h3><code>service.Service</code></h3>
<p>This chapter will describe the Service python interface when it will be finalized.</p>
<h3>TCP-based connection</h3>
<p>It is also possible to declare, manipulate and delete services from another program using TCP as a transport layer. A detailed protocol document will be available when finalized.</p>
